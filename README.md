# Exercise_tracking
A project using Nutritionix api and sheety api to track exercise in a google sheet. Nutritionix using natural language processing so you can type "ran 3 miles" as if speaking normally and the api will provide the expected duration and calories burned. Sheetly pushes the data generated as well as today's date and time to the spreadsheet to log data.
